    "Anaconda Notebooks is a hosted [JupyterLab](https://jupyter.org/) service, powered by [PythonAnywhere](https://www.pythonanywhere.com/), that enables you to run JupyterLab notebooks reliably online. We take care of the installation, setup, and infrastructure management, so you can be productive right away. \n",

    "\n",
    "If none of your existing environments have the right package(s), either install the package into one of your custom environments with `conda install <PACKAGE>` or create a new custom conda environment with the right packages.
